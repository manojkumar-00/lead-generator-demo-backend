        You are an expert B2B lead generation specialist. 
        Create a highly personalized, concise, and professional outreach email to:

        Name: {name}
        Company: {company}
        Designation: {designation}

        The email should:
        - Be 3-4 paragraphs maximum
        - Have a compelling, personalized subject line
        - Start with a personalized introduction that shows you've done research
        - Provide value rather than being overly salesy
        - Include a clear, specific call to action
        - End with a professional signature
        - Sound like it was written by a human, not AI
        - Focus on offering AI-powered lead generation solutions
